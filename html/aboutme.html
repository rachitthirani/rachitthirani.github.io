                My name is Rachit Thirani. I am a passionate Software Developer with expertise in Full Stack Web Development and Data Analysis. Programming and computers facinated me since my childhood. My parents wanted to provide me with something which they were not lucky enough to use in their generation and this hooked me up to amazing world of computers.
