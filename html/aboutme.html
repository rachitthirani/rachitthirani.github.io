                My name is Rachit Thirani. I am a passionate Software Developer with expertise in Full Stack Web Development and Data Analysis. My passion for computers started early in my life. After my first tryst with computers, which started with Logo, I realized that I had found my first and true love. I primarily used it to create various shapes and produce line graphics. I gradually moved on to the ‘BASIC’ language. I took to computer programming like a fish to water and very soon it became my career path. I was very clear early on that I would become a computer professional.

               I did my Bachelors from Manipal University in Information Technology, which can be considered as my first formal introduciton to high level programming concepts and skills. The courses which I took kept my passion growing and the hunger to learn more never stopped on growing.
